# What is this?:
This is an open source version of a RESTful API that I will soon be deploying. I'm not really good at this so should there be anything about the project that I can improve, please do tell me!

# Currently
There is only 1 feature, conversion of celsius to kelvin and fahrenheit, I may consider implementing in some of my future bots alongside conversion of length speed and more!
